        <p>
          Dear Rati,
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s hard to put into words just how grateful I am to have you
          in my life. From the very first moment I can remember, you were
          there—holding my hand, making me laugh when I felt low, and
          always showing me the kind of strength that forces me to be
          better. Watching you grow from that baby with an irresistible
          grin into the incredible young woman you are today has been the
          greatest privilege.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’ve been more than a cousin—you’ve been a sister, a best
          friend, and my built-in partner for every adventure (and
          mischief) I can recall. When I trip, you’re there to pick me
          up. When I celebrate, you’re the first one in the front row.
          Your laughter lights up every room, and your kindness never
          goes unnoticed: whether you’re tutoring someone at 2 AM or
          cheering up a stranger, you always remind everyone that they
          matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year, as you turn 19, I want you to know how proud I am of
          everything you’ve accomplished—both big and small. Your
          compassion, your drive, and your unwavering loyalty set you
          apart. I hope this day gives you a thousand reasons to
          smile—just like you’ve given me a thousand reasons to be
          thankful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy 19th, my beautiful, brilliant Rati. May this year bring
          you new dreams to chase, new joys to discover, and every ounce
          of the happiness you deserve. I love you more than words can
          say—today, tomorrow, and always.
        </p>
        <p class="signature">With all my love, Your Cousin/Sister</p>
